  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all 7 requirements (REQ-24 through REQ-30) for converting Saanufox to a Progressive Web App. All core PWA files have been created (manifest.json, sw.js, offline.html) and index.html has been properly modified with required meta tags and links. The service worker implements proper caching strategies and respects Internet Identity authentication constraints.",

      "reason": "The service worker caches multiple specific image assets (hero-banner, video-thumb-1 through video-thumb-6) which were not explicitly requested in the requirements. While this aligns with the general caching strategy, these specific assets go beyond what was specified.",
