# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Transform Saanufox into a fully installable Progressive Web App with offline support.

**Planned changes:**
- Update PWA manifest with complete installability requirements (start_url, scope, icons with maskable support)
- Enhance service worker with offline-first caching strategy for video thumbnails and API responses
- Add install prompt component to encourage users to install the app to their home screen
- Add comprehensive PWA meta tags to index.html for enhanced mobile experience
- Improve offline fallback page with helpful information and Saanufox-branded design

**User-visible outcome:** Users can install Saanufox as a standalone app on their devices, access cached video content offline, and receive a native app-like experience with smooth installation prompts and offline functionality.
