# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Perform a complete fresh rebuild of the Saanufox video streaming platform with new canister IDs to permanently resolve the "Canister ID Not Resolved" error.

**Planned changes:**
- Generate completely new backend and frontend canister IDs
- Rebuild entire application from scratch with proper backend canister initialization
- Configure correct actor routing and gateway resolution settings
- Verify all existing features remain functional (video upload/playback, authentication, favorites, watchlist, profiles, admin analytics)

**User-visible outcome:** Users can access the Saanufox streaming platform without encountering the "Canister ID Not Resolved" error, with all video streaming, authentication, and profile features working correctly.
